# COMP40

This repository contains my solutions to Tufts Comp40 Machine Structure and Assembly Language Programming. In this course, we programmed a lot of interesting projects, written in either C or some form of assembly language.

In this course, we practiced pair programming, meaning all assignments completed were worked on by myself and a partner. (We have different partner for different assignments).

Note: You should not see my solutions if you are taking comp40 or you plan to. You will learn a lot by doing these assignments with your partner.
