Acknowledgment: We met with multiple TA's throughout the assignment
to discuss our code and bottlenecks. 


Assembly code analysis: Our final um executable was significantly quicker than
our original design. The routine that takes the most time is new_segment(). 
This function creates a new array to represent a segment. After analyzing the 
assembly code, we could not find a way to improve this portion of code since
most of the time is spent on malloc/int_malloc. There is a for loop to 
initialize the array with zeros, but we could not get rid of this or find 
another method without inherently changing the structure of our progam. 


Time spent:
analyzing - 2 hours
solving - 18 hours
