Help received:
We asked the TAs about the testing procedures, along with asking several 
questions on piazza regarding the use of methods in hanson's data structures
and other questions related to the homework specification.
We also browsed stackoverflow to fix common bugs regarding string manipulation.

Implementation:
Brightness, readaline, and simlines have all been implemented successfully 
to our knowledge, including readaline being able to handle lines longer than
200 characters.

Hours worked on the assignment:
We worked approximately 18 hours on the homework assignment, which includes 
coming up with the design, lab 1, the implementation as well as testing.
