Help received:
We asked the TAs about the pbm format, along with asking several 
questions on piazza regarding the use of methods in Bit vector and 
UArray interface.


Implementation:
sudoku, uarray2, bit2, and unblackedges have all been implemented 
successfully to our knowledge. 
The UArray2 and Bit2 interfaces replicate
the functionality of Hanson's UArray and Bit interfaces, and are heavily 
dependent on Hanson's interfaces. Moreover, in sudoku, we used our 
UArray2 interface to store the pixel intensities and used one dimensional 
UArray to check for duplicates whereas in unblackedges, we used 
Bit2 interface to store the pixel intensities and change the black edge 
pixels to white. We used a simple breadth first search algorithm (bfs) to 
find the black edge pixels in unblackedges by making use of a queue data 
structure (Hanson's Sequence).



Hours worked on the assignment:
We worked approximately 14 hours on the homework assignment, which includes 
coming up with the design, lab 2, the implementation as well as testing.
